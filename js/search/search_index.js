inspector-metrics\nbasic usage\nAt least a MetricRegistry, a Metric and a MetricReporter is necessary\nto use the library.\nSupported metric types:\n* Counter - measures an integer value (e.g. \"how many time was my function called, number of bookings in a sales system\")\n* MonotoneCounter - a monotonically increasing integer value (e.g. \"error count\")\n* Event - ad-hoc event to report events (e.g. \"application start / deployment\", \"batch import started / ended\")\n* Gauge - measurement of a value (e.g. \"number of waiting threads on a resource\")\n* HdrHistogram - recording and analyzing sampled data value counts across a configurable integer value range with configurable value precision\n* Histogram - measures the statistical distribution of all values\n* Meter - measures the rate of events over time (e.g. \"requests per second\")\n* Timer - measures call-rate of a function and the distribution of the duration of all calls\nThere are libraries which collect some metrics:\n\nnode VM - collects memory & garbage collection metric for node VM\n\nThe library ships with a default console MetricReporter.\nSome other reporter:\n* AMQP\n* Carbon / Graphite\n* CSV\n* Elasticsearch\n* Influx\n* NATS\n* Prometheus / Pushgateway\n```typescript\nimport { LoggerReporter, MetricRegistry, Timer } from \"inspector-metrics\";\n// a registry is a collection of metric objects\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\n// the reporter prints the stats\nconst reporter = new LoggerReporter({\n    log: global.console,\n});\n// a new timer instance\nconst requests: Timer = registry.newTimer(\"requests\");\nreporter.addMetricRegistry(registry);\nreporter.start();\n// example usage\nsetInterval(() => {\n    // should report a few milliseconds\n    requests.time(() => {\n        let a = 0;\n        // tslint:disable-next-line:prefer-const\n        let b = 1;\n        for (let i = 0; i \nCounter\n```typescript\nimport { Counter, MetricRegistry } from \"inspector-metrics\";\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\nconst requestCount: Counter = registry.newCounter(\"requestCount\");\n// +1\nrequestCount.increment(1);\n// -1\nrequestCount.decrement(1);\n// =0\nrequestCount.getCount();\nrequestCount.reset();\n```\nMonotoneCounter\n```typescript\nimport { MonotoneCounter, MetricRegistry } from \"inspector-metrics\";\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\nconst errorCount: MonotoneCounter = registry.newMonotoneCounter(\"errorCount\");\n// +1\nerrorCount.increment(1);\n// causes error\nerrorCount.increment(-1);\n// =1\nerrorCount.getCount();\nerrorCount.reset();\n```\nEvent\n```typescript\nimport { BaseMetric, Event, MetricRegistry } from \"inspector-metrics\";\n// common application tags - applied to each metric / event\nconst tags: Map = new Map();\ntags.set(\"application\", \"project-name\");\ntags.set(\"hostname\", \"127.0.0.4\");\n// the reporter prints the stats\nconst reporter = new LoggerReporter({\n    log: global.console,\n    tags,\n});\n// not connected to a MetricRegistry like the other metrics\nconst event = new Event(\"application_started\", \"signals an application start\")\n    .setValue(\"started\")\n    .setTag(\"mode\", \"test\")\n    .setTag(\"component\", \"main\");\n// directly send to time-series DB\nawait reporter.reportEvent(event);\n```\nGauge\n```typescript\nimport { BaseMetric, Gauge, MetricRegistry, SimpleGauge } from \"inspector-metrics\";\nclass ArrayLengthGauge extends BaseMetric implements Gauge {\npublic constructor(name: string, private a: Array) {\n    super();\n    this.name = name;\n}\n\npublic getValue(): number {\n    return this.a.length;\n}}\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\nconst queueSize: Gauge = new SimpleGauge(\"requestCount\");\nlet myArray: number[] = [];\nconst arrayLength: Gauge = new ArrayLengthGauge(\"arrayLength\", myArray);\nregistry.registerMetric(queueSize);\nregistry.registerMetric(arrayLength);\nqueueSize.setValue(12345);\n// 12345\nqueueSize.getValue();\nmyArray.push(1);\nmyArray.push(2);\nmyArray.push(3);\n// 3\narrayLength.getValue();\n```\nHistogram\n```typescript\nimport { Histogram, MetricRegistry, Snapshot } from \"inspector-metrics\";\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\n// measures a duration / latency\nconst requestLatency: Histogram = registry.newHistogram(\"requestLatency\");\nrequestLatency.update(12345);\nrequestLatency.update(23456);\nrequestLatency.update(34567);\n// a copy of the current values\nconst snapshot: Snapshot = requestLatency.getSnapshot();\n// mean count\nconst mean: number = snapshot.getMean();\n```\nHdrHistogram\n```typescript\nimport { HdrHistogram, MetricRegistry, Snapshot } from \"inspector-metrics\";\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\n// measures a duration / latency between 1 and 1000000000 nanoseconds\nconst requestLatency: HdrHistogram = registry.newHdrHistogram(\"requestLatency\", 1, 1000000000);\n// 102 microseconds in nanoseconds\nrequestLatency.update(102000);\n// 4.390 milliseconds in nanoseconds\nrequestLatency.update(4390000);\n// only snapshot interface - always uses the current values\n// since the native-hdr-histogram is used as a reference\nconst snapshot: Snapshot = requestLatency.getSnapshot();\n// mean count\nconst mean: number = snapshot.getMean();\n```\nMeter\n```typescript\nimport { Meter, MetricRegistry } from \"inspector-metrics\";\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\nconst callCount: Meter = registry.newMeter(\"callCount\");\ncallCount.mark(1);\nconst count: number = callCount.getCount();\nconst m15: number = callCount.get15MinuteRate();\nconst m5: number = callCount.get5MinuteRate();\nconst m1: number = callCount.get1MinuteRate();\nconst mean: number = callCount.getMeanRate();\n```\nTimer\n```typescript\nimport { MetricRegistry, MILLISECOND, Snapshot, StopWatch, Timer } from \"inspector-metrics\";\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\nconst callStats: Timer = registry.newTimer(\"callStats\");\ncallStats.addDuration(100, MILLISECOND);\n// 1\nconst count: number = callStats.getCount();\n// ~1\nconst m15: number = callStats.get15MinuteRate();\n// ~1\nconst m5: number = callStats.get5MinuteRate();\n// ~1\nconst m1: number = callStats.get1MinuteRate();\n// ~1\nconst mean: number = callStats.getMeanRate();\nlet snapshot: Snapshot = callStats.getSnapshot();\n// some value around 100000000 (100ms in nanoseconds)\nconst mean: number = snapshot.getMean();\nconst timer: StopWatch = callStats.newStopWatch();\ntimer.start();\n// 100ms has passed\ntimer.stop();\nsnapshot = callStats.getSnapshot();\n// snapshot gets updated through stop-watch ...\nsnapshot.getMean();\ncallStats.time(() => {\n    // some time has passed\n});\n// works with promise too\nawait callStats.timeAsync(async () => {\n    // some time has passed\n});\nsnapshot = callStats.getSnapshot();\n// snapshot gets updated through time function ...\nsnapshot.getMean();\n```\nMetricListeners\n```typescript\nimport { Metric, MetricRegistry, MetricRegistryListener, MetricRegistryListenerRegistration } from \"inspector-metrics\";\nclass Listener implements MetricRegistryListener {\npublic metricAdded(name: string, metric: Metric): void {\n    console.log(`added metric ${name}: ${metric}`);\n}\n\npublic metricRemoved(name: string, metric: Metric): void {\n    console.log(`removed metric ${name}: ${metric}`);\n}}\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\nconst registration: MetricRegistryListenerRegistration = registry.addListener(new Listener());\n// prints \"added metric requests: Counter...\" via console\nregistry.newCounter(\"requests\");\n// removes the listener\nregistration.remove();\n```\nMetric Groups\nEach metric can have a group, which is used to gather different metrics\nwithin metric reporter instances. E.g. if only gauges are used\nto gather metrics data a group can be used to report them all as one\nmeasure point with different fields.\n```typescript\nimport { Gauge, MetricRegistry } from \"inspector-metrics\";\nconst registry = new MetricRegistry();\n// reports the internal storage capacity of a queue\nconst capacity: Gauge = ...;\n// reports the element count in the queue\nconst queueSize: Gauge = ...;\n// all values grouped as buffer\nregistry.registerMetric(queueSize, \"buffer\");\nregistry.registerMetric(capacity, \"buffer\");\n// counts the number of allocations during the execution of the application\nregistry.newCounter(\"newAllocations\", \"buffer\");\n// the reporter can now report the values as a single measurement point if supported ...\n```\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 \nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
