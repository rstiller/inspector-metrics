This library is made for [inspector-metrics](https://github.com/rstiller/inspector-metrics)
node module and is meant to be used with `nodejs`.  

All metrics from the [inspector-metrics](https://github.com/rstiller/inspector-metrics) library
can exported into CSV files.

Take a look at the [Documentation](https://rstiller.github.io/inspector-metrics/).

## install

`npm install --save inspector-csv`

## basic usage

`example.ts`
```typescript
import {
    CsvMetricReporter,
    DefaultCsvFileWriter,
} from "inspector-csv";
import { MetricRegistry, Timer } from "inspector-metrics";

// metric registry is used in the application code to measure durations, error codes, etc...
const registry: MetricRegistry = new MetricRegistry();

// some timers for this example
const requests1: Timer = registry.newTimer("requests1");
const requests2: Timer = registry.newTimer("requests2");
const requests3: Timer = registry.newTimer("requests3");

requests1.setGroup("requests");
requests2.setGroup("requests");

requests1.setTag("host", "127.0.0.1");
requests2.setTag("host", "127.0.0.2");
requests3.setTag("host", "127.0.0.3");

// default csv file writer
const writer = new DefaultCsvFileWriter({});

// configure CSV metric reporter instance
const reporter = new CsvMetricReporter({
    columns: ["date", "group", "name", "field", "value"],
    writer,
});

// register registry in the reporter
reporter.addMetricRegistry(registry);
// start reporting
reporter.start();

// simulate a running application which produces some custom measures
setInterval(() => requests1.time(() => { ... }), 100);
setInterval(() => requests2.time(() => { ... }), 50);
setInterval(() => requests3.time(() => { ... }), 25);
```

## multi process support (nodejs cluster)

By default forked processes are sending the metrics as inter-process message  
to the master process. The `CsvMetricReporter` is listening for those messages  
and writes the metrics from the other processes into the CSV file.  

Only the master process writes the header of the CSV file.  
Also each write-operation is handled by the master process.  

To disable this behavior set the `DisabledClusterOptions` when creating an instance.  

In each case you should set the `pid` as reporter tag.  
And in case of disabling cluster support the `pid` should be part of the filename.  

```typescript
import { tagsToMap, DisabledClusterOptions } from "inspector-metrics";
import { CsvMetricReporter } from "inspector-csv";

const writer = new DefaultCsvFileWriter({
    filename: async () => `${moment().format("YYYYMMDDHH00")}_${process.pid}_metrics.csv`
});

// configure CSV metric reporter instance
const reporter = new CsvMetricReporter({
    clusterOptions: new DisabledClusterOptions(),
    columns: ["date", "group", "name", "field", "value", "type", "tags"],
    writer,
    ...
});

// set "pid" to process id
reporter.setTags(tagsToMap({
    pid: `${process.pid}`,
}));
```
