inspector-metrics\nbasic usage\nAt least a MetricRegistry, a Metric and a MetricReporter is necessary\nto use the library.\nSupported metric types:\n\nCounter - measures an integer value (e.g. \"how many time was my function called, number of bookings in a sales system\")\nMonotoneCounter - a monotonically increasing integer value (e.g. \"error count\")\nGauge - measurement of a value (e.g. \"number of waiting threads on a resource\")\nHistogram - measures the statistical distribution of all values\nMeter - measures the rate of events over time (e.g. \"requests per second\")\nTimer - measures call-rate of a function and the distribution of the duration of all calls\n\nThe library ships with a default console MetricReporter.\nSome other reporter:\n\nCarbon /
